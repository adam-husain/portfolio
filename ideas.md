# Portfolio Concept: Space to Earth Career Journey

## Theme
Interstellar-inspired descent from cosmos to ground, representing career timeline from present to origins.

## Direction
- **Scroll Down** = Travel back in time
- **Space (Top)** = Present roles
- **Earth (Bottom)** = Career beginnings

## Visual Zones

### 1. Deep Space — Nation.dev
- Nebula, stars, cosmic void
- "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night" floating as ambient light text
- Remote work = floating in the digital cosmos

### 2. Orbital — Outer Insights
- Satellites in orbit
- Data streams visualized as light trails
- Big data / LLM work as cosmic information flow

### 3. Moon Surface — Social Presence
- Lunar landscape with transmission towers
- Earth visible on horizon (global reach)
- Social connections as planetary scale

### 4. Stratosphere — Petville Global
- Airplane at high altitude
- Adam jumps out (the entrepreneurial leap)
- Thin atmosphere, edge of space

### 5. Cloudscape — SHRDC
- Hot air balloon floating
- Mountain peaks piercing clouds
- Adam silhouette in freefall
- "Vision detection" = seeing from above

### 6. Cityscape — Snyper Labs
- Dubai-inspired futuristic skyline
- Burj Khalifa silhouette
- Neon lights, game dev aesthetic
- 3D graphics / Unreal Engine vibe

### 7. Forest Floor — Self-Employed
- Pinecone trees
- Adam lands, trees bend with spring physics
- 2 pinecones drop, slide Adam out
- Text reveals on bend (freelance origins)

## Post-Landing (Future)
- Education section
- Projects showcase
- Contact/Footer

## Animation Style
- Static images transformed via GSAP
- Scroll-driven storytelling
- Spring physics for pinecone landing
- Parallax layering throughout
